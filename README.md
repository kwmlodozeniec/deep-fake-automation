# deep-fake-automation

Automation scripts for controlling [ManyCam](https://manycam.com/), [Swapface](https://www.swapface.org/) and [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) to aid deep fake generation.

I wrote this code as part of a tech task for an interview. I will not mention the company but after many rounds of very positive feedback, they cancelled the final interview at the last moment and ghosted me after I have submitted the tech task. The code is minimal and it automates the above three applications to demonstrate how deep fake video generation could be automated. I have decided to upload this code to my GitHub account in the hope that it will stop said company from being able to use it for commercial purposes without appropriate attribution.

The code is written in Python and uses the [PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library to control the mouse and keyboard. There are plenty of improvements that can be made that I have documented as part of the tech task, but I will not be implementing them as this was just a proof of concept.

Code has been tested on a Macbook Pro with M3 Pro chip and 18GB of RAM. The applications used, aside from OBS, are very junky and poorly optimised for automation.

The code is free to use, modify and distribute, as long as you give credit to the author.
